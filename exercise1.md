# Exercise 11.1: Warming up

Language: Rust

With Rust the dependency initializations are done with the use of Rust’s official package manager called Cargo. For instance Cargo is used for setting up linting, tests and other CI setup related actions. For Rust the primary linting tool that is used is Clippy. Clippy is a collection of different lints that are used to catch some of the most common mistakes in Rust code and it can be run with a simple command such as “cargo clippy”. As for testing purposes, whenever a new library project is made with Cargo, simultaneously a test module is automatically generated with a test function in it. This module gives a template for writing Rust related tests. In order to change a function into a test function, “#[test]” needs to be added on the line before the function begins and to run Rust tests the command “cargo test” is used.

In terms of CI alternatives compared to Jenkins and Github actions, there are different platforms that can be used for the same things. For instance, GitLab CI, Travis CI and CircleCI. With there being solutions for self-hosted and cloud-based CI platforms there needs to be consideration on a project in terms of which one suits the best. Most often than not self-hosting means more control, however at the same time it means more technical work to set up and maintain it. Whereas using a cloud-based solution is more maintainable and allows to be more easily scalable. Now of course the decision is most of the times on requirements or preference but I would say using a cloud-based solution is better as it allows for more flexibility.
